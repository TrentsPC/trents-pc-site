It's Greatest Hits, and I ain't tryna hide it

Do you?

For the first time
I like it when he's inside
Thinking about the next time
He's coming round to mine

I believe in dreams
Do you?
How does it feel?
Fever in the night
Dreamin' in the dark
See you on the other side

Baby, you know I could go on
So play me one more song

Imagine I'm Madonna
Imagine I'm the Madonna
Dressed in bluе
No, dressed in pink
Gabbana
Feathеr boa
Marie Antoinette
You wanna know her
Riding in a limousine

I believe in dreams
Do you?
How does it feel?
Fever in the night
Dreamin' in the dark
See you on the other side

Just wanted to feel what you feel inside
(Get a car, ride)
Come to me on the third floor
Want you to know what I know in my mind
(Come on, baby, speedy, quick)
Sit with me on the roof top
I wanna see what you see through your eyes
(Come on, baby, baby blue)
Come to me on the third floor`;

I can be a stripper if you want me to
It's been a while since I played for ya

Like a DJ
Like a dancer
Your arms and legs
Covered in little white hairs
Like a carpet
No, like a mohair sweater
"That's sweet baby" you smiled and said to me
As if I couldn't have said it any better

You got it
Flaunt it
Everything is good, girl
Take it
Leave it
Let him know you do care
Drop it
Stop it
Step into the now, girl
See it
Best believe it
Lean into it safe, girl
Lean into it safe, girl

Shifting about in her goddamn crochet pants staring at god knows what
Bring you to the apartment that I'd like to own
Tell you that I'm broke when we're all alone
I can be a stripper if you want me to
Tapped him behind and he looked at me with the same milky eyes that seem to be spilling up the floor
It's been a while since I played for ya
Get a Switch and I'll connect with ya
Never thought I'd be a g-g-gamer girl

And I knew you liked me

What's it all about?
I put it to rest with my best - my good friend
Will it ever end?
I wrote all these songs about you
And maybe you came through
But I never knew
I've been here before, too

What's it all about? (What's it all about?)
That wonderful night you give to me
You treat me to
Once in a blue moon
I wish you'd just touch me
Yet I still sit and wait
Yeah, I think we'd be great together, too

Hurting is one thing, but
Waiting's another, yeah
What's this all about my friend
Good, good friend, too
Hurting is one thing, but
Waiting's another, yeah
What's this all about my friend
Good, good friend, too`;

Tower's blue and the sky is black
I feel the night
I see it, it's on my back
On my back
It makes me cry
This European air, I swear it does
Randomly I'm grateful for
Grateful for a night
Solemn night walker
To our telephone talker
It's you
Maybe it's you

Oh, one night
On the bridge we stood
Concrete over water
I think you remind me of the night
But also of the day
I think of Italy, champagne
I think of Spain

I wanna be there
I want more than my head
Should've meant it when I said
Now I'm more than my head

I'm glad you take me as I am
Whatever shape with woman, man
Black or blue, a filthy cheat I am
And you still come to see the band
Light and dark at once
Never lonely in holy metronomy
So dazzlingly dark because of its bright
And truth is God and God is light
The space behind the sky
In which the darkness depends on
In the creation of light

Oh, one night
On the bridge we stood
Concrete over water
I think you remind me of the night
But also of the day
I think of Italy, champagne
I think of Spain

I wanna be there
Two sides of the moon
Black spots on the sun`;

My organs bob about in the dark
In a mustard mist, in my stomach vase
Barely connected by the tubes, but it's dark
In my eggshell

If it were a baby, I'd name her Angst
And hold her tight in my chest
And she'd grow, from a small, hard stone
Into my own, the problem my own
That would disease everything, and everyone

When I birthed her, I bought the red
When I met her, I cried the sticks for her
She came out crimson, on the bathroom floor
With her baby weight she kept me down
On the blue linoleum
Hmm

She tortured me still
With the darkest spell
Fought about like forever and ever
She pulled on my hair, whispered in my ear
"You fucking love
You love to fuck
To fuck it up"
Fucking listen to her sing

This red cord
The baby grabbed the lump in my throat
And pulled the cord
This is wild she said
This is it
This is madness
Don't you love it
Her love's gonna change
Hear it, better believe it
Let it sink in
As his titanic rises
And the sun streams in
And you hear heart of lord
Behind the locked door
And I'm ringed around your neck
He sinks, you float
But you don't`;

Disco sticks to run around

Five stars but it
Ain't hard 'cause it
Comes naturally

Get the — off my patio
When I'm alone with ya
I don't rock with ya
I don't speak to the guys that I pass in the Greek quarter
Back, back to the board with the decor
'Cause you know
Are you hearing that?
(What?)
No, pick up your phone
I think I know who's calling

Looked at the moon, press X at the star

You tipped me off that Glasgow could be a place to go
I said to you, "Yes," but I probably won't
You used to write to me, baby, and now you don't

I'm not coming to Glasgow
I'll just see you at the shore
I know myself
Going 'round again
I trust myself
I'm a woman she believes in
I touch myself
Every time I see
What's missing from my life

You checked in to a holiday spa
Broke it off with your man and left in the getaway car
The days went on and I thought, "This is poor rapport"
Guess I don't feel that way about you anymore, baby

I'm not coming to Glasgow
I'll just see you at the shore
I know myself
Going 'round again
I trust myself
I'm a woman she believes in
I touch myself

What's missing from my life

In that moment, I am so alone

Just twice we've spoken since
But what have I to give you - what am I to you?
Gas and blood, and blood, and blood
It is love you are full of
And you know who you hate

I sent you my heart

Since then we've spoken trice
But what if you were to kill me off or worse, yourself?
Stop and wound him; do what you have to do to him
But not me and you, cause it's me and you

I sent you my heart

Love forever -ever
Frankly never broken
Together -ether

I sent you my heart`;

With linked limbs
And your knees make the hinge

Amount to nothing
As we lay there just kissing

I think you are the arrow of my eye
Because I feel the best I ever have
Me as me, you as you
Always, a friend of friends
Because of I don't know what
Or if I can have what they want

We sit in and drink
And love cannot stop for a second
Touching me, you, and him
Just three nights and my arm on your thigh
And your fingers in mine

Happy looking, yellow in green
The love of her sister before she hit thirteen
Come to see her arrow, her sparkler girl
In a house full of other girls
Enough for a feeling to settle`;

I tasted the city, ate out in the city
But the sky called up to me and it said
"Here, look at me, city"
Oh, what do I want, what do I want?
"I suddenly want the city", I thought
A thousand thoughts for a thousand times
I've loved in sheets with it on my mind
You opened the doors
The doors onto the veranda
But I ran outside in the mustard air
With my arms outstretched to feel it

I breathed in a city like a fool
But only because it was you
My homing guide
And you told me I could have what you could not provide
Well, I believed you so
That we would last forever, we thought, we thought
Well, I told you in the city light
And your face was warm and your eyes were bright

I wish I'd known
I was alone
In city life

The hideous monster and the beaver
Ugly monster kept house with the beaver
Head scraping like against the kitchen ceiling
Cook for the beaver on the plastic dishes
And all the land was ice, ice
Grey morning light
"You poor baby beaver, beaver," he said
I sat on the beaver's face and he sat on the beaver's face
And told him what the problem was

In the light the monster was frying four eggs in a huge black frying pan
And golden buckwheat and rye in iron toaster, hit the ceiling, onto the blue tiled, err
The Dutch china plates on the round red table
Rose petal jam, orange-lemon
Ginger marmalade, blossom jelly, jelly
The beaver was taking a shower, he refused to use shower curtains
So blue water was flooding the bathroom

The only thing the beaver saw was the white morning sunlight, and
And the only thing he heard was the shower water falling like the beating heart
Monster to the bear, "So it's all power, power, power can't sleep
Or think or dream of anything else
I hate you and I hate your money"
The bear raged, the bear forgot himself and threw himself against the door even harder`;

I fled the penthouse suite
And shed my snake-suit skin
This isn't a city
Where is the city?

Supposed to be looking for love
Oh, way out west I was

A taxi picked me up and dropped me off
Whilst he took in her face and her clothes off
In my room, in my room
I couldn't move on but look at you

My head hit the sink
I really scared him
And worse, I lost a friend in him
I'm not myself when I've been caning
It's been draining
To think I knew a Tring trick

I'm not well, oh I'm not well
I burnt my face in the city
In the city hell
You'll never know how deep I hurt
I dragged it home so you could tell
That I'm not well

Do you want a piece of me?
Did you think that thing was me?
Do ya think that's who I wanna be?
None of you can manage me
Do ya think that's where I wanna be?
Something I don't wanna be`;
